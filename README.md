# Predictive-Modeling
## Introduction
This repository is based on my master's degree program with Grand Canyon University. 
The purpose of this class is to take us through using predictive analysis to make a prediction.
As part of this class, we learned how to apply the data science methodology, which includes understanding the problem,
data preparation and exploration, setup, modeling, and evaluation. 
There are eight weeks of lectures for this class, and each class folder is provided, including the codes, datasets, and written reports.
## Requirements
Python program is the programming language used for this class. All code is built using jupyter notebook.
