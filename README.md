# Predictive-Modeling
This repository is based on my master's degree program with Grand Canyon University. The Masters's degree program at GCU has been a journey that I can say so far I am proud of. We have eight weeks in this class, and I have created folders for each week that includes the codes and written technical reports.

## Program used 
As part of the course, I used jupyter notebook 

### Usage
To use this code, download python and Anconda and then load the projects into jupyter to veiw the code.

#### Reports
The repository contains written reports for each week
